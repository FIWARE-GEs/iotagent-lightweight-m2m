# Deprecated functionality

Deprecated features are features that lightweightM2M-iotagent stills support but that are not maintained or evolved any
longer. In particular:

-   Bugs or issues related with deprecated features and not affecting any other feature are not addressed (they are
    closed in github.com as soon as they are spotted).
-   Documentation on deprecated features is removed from the repository documentation. Documentation is still available
    in the documentation set associated to older versions (in the repository release branches).
-   Deprecated functionality is eventually removed from lightweightM2M-iotagent. Thus you are strongly encouraged to
    change your implementations using lightweightM2M-iotagent in order not rely on deprecated functionality.

A list of deprecated features and the version in which they were deprecated follows:

-   Support to NGSI v1.
-   Support to Node.js v4 in lightweightM2M-iotagent 1.0.0. The use of Node.js v8 is highly recommended.

## Using old lightweightM2M-iotagent versions

Although you are encouraged to use always the newest lightweightM2M-iotagent version, take into account the following
information in the case you want to use old versions:

-   Code corresponding to old releases is available at the
    [lightweightM2M-iotagent GitHub repository](https://github.com/telefonicaid/lightweightm2m-iotagent). Each release
    number (e.g. `0.4.0`) has associated the following: A tag, e.g. `0.4.0`. It points to the base version. A release
    branch, `release/0.4.0`. The HEAD of this branch usually matches the aforementioned tag. However, if some hotfixes
    were developed on the base version, this branch contains such hotfixes.
-   Documentation corresponding to old versions can be found at
    [readthedocs.io](https://fiware-iotagent-lwm2m.readthedocs.io).Use the panel in the right bottom corner to navigate
    to the right version.
