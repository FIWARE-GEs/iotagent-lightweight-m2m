This Internet of Things Agent is a bridge that can be used to communicate devices using the OMA Lightweight M2M protocol
and NGSI Context Brokers (like Orion). Lightweight M2M is a lightweight protocol aimed to constrained devices and
communications where the bandwidth and device memory may be limited resources.

Github's [README.md](https://github.com/telefonicaid/lightweightm2m-iotagent/blob/master/README.md) provides a good
documentation summary. The [User Manual](userGuide.md) and the [Admin Guide](administrationGuide.md) cover more advanced
topics.
